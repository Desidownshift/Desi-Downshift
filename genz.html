    <h1>An Old Soul with a Fast Charger: Trying to Fit In</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>I'm Gen Z by birth, but on most days, I feel like a misplaced millennial — or worse, someone time-travelled straight out of a pre-Instagram decade. It's like being a cassette in a Bluetooth world. Everyone's grooving to trends, while I'm here just trying to make sense of the tempo.</p>

    <p>For starters, the whole idea of modern relationships? I'm lost. Somewhere between "talking stages," "soft-launches," "hard launches," "ghosting," and "body count" conversations, I find myself quietly sipping my chai and wondering when love became a software update. I grew up thinking love was slow-cooked — something with depth, emotion, and the kind of drama that didn't need a screen recording. Now, it's a blink-and-mute story saga that disappears before you even know what you felt.</p>

    <p>Fashion? That's another orbit. I still drool over the grace of timeless classics — white shirts, linen kurtas, sarees that don't try to turn into hoodies. But everywhere I go, it's chaos couture. People dress like walking Pinterest boards powered by caffeine and crisis. Crop tops have become crop dots, pants are missing actual legs, and shoes? Half the time I can't tell if they're for hiking or heartbreak.</p>
    
    <p>Let's not even talk about music. While the world dances to techno beats, lo-fi remixes, and vocals processed more than airline food, I sit there longing for a raw, unfiltered voice backed by a tabla, maybe a sarangi, and definitely no DJ named after a fruit. I want music that breathes, that breaks, that bleeds — not playlists made by AI that sound like a Siri fever dream.</p>

    <p>And oh, culture. Here's where it really stings. You bring up traditions, talk about the Vedas, or casually mention our rich philosophies, and suddenly people look at you like you're about to sell essential oils. But speak in a fake British accent, name-drop Freud or quote a New York Times article, and boom — you're sophisticated. When did revering our roots become cringe?</p>

    <p>It's not that I hate Gen Z. In fact, I am Gen Z. But I don't fit. I'm the glitch in the reel, the unskippable ad in a playlist of chaos. I enjoy silence, I think deep before I speak, I love writing poems that rhyme, and I prefer tulsi tea over tequila shots. Call me outdated — I call it peaceful.</p>

    <p>I'm not saying the world is wrong. I'm just saying I don't vibe with it sometimes. I still believe in authenticity, emotional depth, conversations that aren't cut short by DNDs, and music that doesn't beg to trend on Reels.</p>

    <p>So here's to the ones like me — the ones scrolling through a Gen Z world with millennial fingers, retro tastes, and a soul that refuses to be auto-tuned. We may not always fit, but damn, we sure feel.<br>

    Namaste to that.</p>
