    <h1>Unreserved Realities</h1>

    <p>Travelling in the general compartment of an Indian train isn't a journey — it's an awakening. It's like a crash course in sociology, psychology, crowd management, and sheer survival. One trip and you come out as a stronger, humbler, slightly squashed version of yourself.</p>
    
    <p>Let's start with the aunties. Ah, the gossip queens of the rails. I once got so emotionally invested in one aunty's monologue about how her son bought her a Prada bag that I almost forgot my stop. She went on about how he sent gifts to all the relatives — masis, buas, and chachis — but also specifically told them not to ask for anything else because he had loans to repay. The emotional drama, the guilt-tripping, the flex — it was better than anything on OTT.</p>
    
    <p>Then there was the transgender person who approached me for money. I showed her my empty wallet with a sheepish smile, expecting her to curse me or at least clap in disapproval. Instead, she surprised me by offering me 20 rupees from her own collection. Yes, I graciously refused, but I was astonished with this act of kindness. That one gesture had more humanity than a hundred panel discussions on empathy.</p>
    
    <p>The standing hours? Torture. You don't stand — you hover. You levitate with one foot angled like a ballerina and the other squeezed between a sleeping uncle's suitcase and someone else's leg. There's barely enough space to breathe, let alone exist. And if you ever find floor space, it's sacred ground.<br>
    Speaking of floor space, I once slept on a pile of mineral water bottles stacked like a makeshift yoga mat. My spine has never forgiven me. But at least it wasn't on top of someone's lunch box — small victories.</p>
    
    <p>But here's the thing — the men and women who travel like this every single day to get to work, to keep life moving, to earn just enough to keep the lights on — they have a kind of quiet toughness that you won't find in air-conditioned cubicles. No complaints, no tantrums, just resilience in its most raw and rugged form.</p>
    
    <p>And yes, the ways we travel are often ridiculous — hanging at the door, sitting on top of luggage racks, occasionally becoming one with the train. I not only hang — sometimes I sit on the staircase, which is really scary in a normal compartment but a casual thing in a general compartment. But that's also the charm. It's chaotic, inconvenient, and borderline unsafe, but it's. It's India with the makeup wiped off.</p>
    
    <p>The general compartment doesn't just take you from Point A to Point B. It drops you straight into the soul of India, with all its noise, kindness, stories, sweat, and spirit — unfiltered and unforgettable.</p>
