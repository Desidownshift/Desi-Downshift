        <h2>Qualifying Heartbreak for the Champions</h2>
        <p>The weekend started melancholic for the multi-World champions. Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton got knocked out in Q2, while Max Verstappen faced a shocker, losing out to Hulkenberg in Q1 with a car that had absolutely zero grip—like driving a banana on ice! Verstappen complained he had a car with no grip, and Red Bull decided enough was enough. They fitted a brand-new Honda power unit delivering an extra 20-30HP boost, made wholesale setup changes, and sent Max to start from the pit lane. At the front, Lando Norris grabbed pole position, followed by the young gun Kimi Antonelli in P2, Charles Leclerc in P3, Oscar Piastri in P4, and George Russell completing the top five.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Lights Out: Chaos from the Get-Go!</h2>
        <p>When the lights went out, everyone was ready for an aggressive start—and boy, did they get it! Kimi had a slightly sluggish launch but defended Oscar brilliantly to retain P2. Down the grid, all hell broke loose. Liam Lawson got whacked by Oliver Bearman, and Hamilton got tapped by Carlos Sainz at Turn 1, dropping Lewis five positions. But the drama didn't stop there. Home hero Gabriel Bortoleto collided with Lance Stroll midway through the opening lap and crashed out, bringing out the Safety Car and breaking Brazilian hearts everywhere. Hamilton, already struggling after the Sainz contact, misjudged the car ahead while coming out of the slipstream and clipped Franco Colapinto's rear, smashing his entire front wing. The earlier tap from Sainz had also damaged his floor, costing him a massive 35-40 points of downforce! </p>

        </div>
        <h2>Verstappen's Rampage from the Pit Lane</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Max Verstappen was in his own world. Starting from the pit lane with that shiny new power unit, he began overtaking cars one after another like they were F2 rookies on a Sunday drive. But the racing gods weren't done testing him—he picked up an early puncture from debris on lap six and had to pit under the Virtual Safety Car. Coming out on fresh rubber, Max resumed his wrath of divebombing and overtaking, carving through the field with surgical precision. It wasn't long before he was into the points, proving once again why he's a multi-time world champion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>The Safety Car ended, and Lando nailed a brilliant restart with a perfect launch through the straight. But Piastri, with the title on his mind, turned ultra-aggressive. He tried to divebomb Antonelli into Turn 1, but locked up hard and slammed into the young Mercedes driver. Kimi was shunted across the track and crashed into Charles Leclerc, who was innocently taking the outside line. Leclerc picked up a puncture and suspension damage, ending his race on the spot—a double DNF for Ferrari! The stewards wasted no time slapping Piastri with a 10-second penalty, while Hamilton's earlier collision with Colapinto earned him a five-second time penalty. Lewis soldiered on, wrestling his damaged SF-25 with horrific rear instability, just trying to serve his penalty before eventually retiring on lap 37.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Midfield Mayhem and the Final Sprint</h2>
        <p>The race continued with a few clean overtakes here and there, but Max was absolutely on fire, hunting down cars ahead of him one by one. When Norris pitted for his second stop to bolt on fresh rubber, Max actually led the race! In the midfield, Oliver Bearman was having the time of his life, divebombing and overtaking like a man possessed—honestly, those Ferrari engines seem to work better in the Haas than the actual Ferrari! Meanwhile, Yuki Tsunoda received a 10-second penalty for contact with Lance Stroll but didn't serve it properly, earning himself another 10-second penalty. Red Bull admitted it was their mistake, but the damage was done, and Yuki finished a disappointing 17th.</p>
        <p>In the closing laps, Verstappen strapped on a brand-new set of soft tires—he had plenty since he never used them for quali—and went on an absolute rampage. He charged past George Russell with ease and set his sights on Antonelli for P2. But Kimi defended like a seasoned warrior, holding Max off beautifully in a thrilling final-lap duel. Max had to settle for P3, just 0.362 seconds behind Antonelli, while Lando cruised to victory. Oscar Piastri, after serving his penalty, battled hard but couldn't catch George Russell and finished P5. Norris extended his championship lead to a healthy 24 points over Piastri, while Verstappen now trails by 49 points with just three races remaining.The midfield, Bearman, Hadjar, Lawson, and Hulkenberg end the race on a DRS train even after 71 goddamn laps.</p>
